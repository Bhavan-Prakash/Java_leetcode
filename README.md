# LeetCode Solutions in Java

This repository contains my personal collection of solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented in **Java**.  
Each problem includes both the **problem statement** and its corresponding **Java solution**, organized systematically for easy navigation and reference.

##  Repository Structure
```plaintext
src/
├── q3.txt   # Problem statement for Question 3
├── q3.java  # Java solution for Question 3
├── q4.txt   # Problem statement for Question 4
├── q4.java  # Java solution for Question 4
└── ...



- **`.txt` files** → contain the original problem statement.
- **`.java` files** → contain the Java implementation of the solution.

##  Features

- Clear separation of **problem statements** and **solutions**.
- All solutions written in **Java** with clean, readable code.
- Easy to navigate and extend as more problems are solved.

##  Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A **learning resource** for practicing algorithms and data structures.
- A **reference collection** for revisiting solved problems.
- A way to **track my progress** on LeetCode over time.

##  How to Use

1. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
2. Open the `.txt` file to read the problem statement.
3. Open the corresponding `.java` file to view the solution.
4. Compile and run the `.java` file in your preferred Java environment.

##  Note

- This is an ongoing repository and will be updated as I solve more LeetCode problems.
- Solutions are written to be **clear and educational** rather than always the most optimized.
